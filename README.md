# AutoCoder
AutoCoder is a Python-based tool that helps generate boilerplate code for coding problems. It streamlines the process of setting up new programming tasks by creating starter files and scaffolding. AutoCoder is especially useful for instructors, course creators, or developers building coding platforms or tutorials.

It simplifies the setup of coding problems, saving time and ensuring consistency across multiple exercises.
